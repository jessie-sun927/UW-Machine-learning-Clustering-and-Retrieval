## Week7 Topics:
* Stochastic gradient ascent
  - adapt for new data
  - very sensitive to parameters, noisy convergence
* Mini-batch gradient ascent 

## Algorithms: 
* stochastic gradient ascent, mini-batch gradient ascent


## Implementation Details of Programming Assignment:

Goal: implement a logistic regression classifier using stochastic gradient ascent, mini-batch gradient ascent

 * Extract features from Amazon product reviews.
 * Convert a dataframe into a NumPy array.
 * Write a function to compute the derivative of log likelihood function with respect to a single coefficient.
 * Implement stochastic gradient ascent and mini-batch gradient ascent
 * Compare convergence of stochastic gradient ascent with that of batch gradient ascent.
